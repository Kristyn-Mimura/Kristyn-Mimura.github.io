## What the Project Was About 

Kat Battle is a simple 2-person fighting game I made using JavaScript as the final project for my Intro to Computer Science class in high school. This was one of the first projects I've made in my Computer Science career and it instilled in me the desire to continue my journey in this field. This project taught me how to design and impliment a game and make simple animations by hand. Everything was made on the 

This is a desciption of the game: My game is a two-player fighting game with cat characters. In the character select screen, you use the arrow keys and spacebar to select each of the player’s characters. If you’re player one, you use A,W,D to move and V to attack and if you’re player two you use the arrow keys to move and K to attack. Every time someone is hit their health bar goes down and the first person to get the opposing person’s health bar all the way down wins. 

## What I Learned
Despite this being a very simple game, it taught me how coding even the simpliest of things can require repeated bashings of heads against walls and late nights kept up in frustration. At one point, I had over 1,800 lines of code that didn't work because I had so much I wanted to do try and do. I kept adding and adding lines of code without seriously testing at each step that in the end, I had a big pile of messed up code. I had to breath, take a step back and start from scratch. This taught me that tyring to jump straight into coding without thinking before starting to think through a solution to a problem first is dangerous. It also taught me the basics of JavaScript as well as animation and sound design.
