## Change is Scary
Change. That’s a scary word. Ever since I turned 18, life’s been a blur of constant readjusting and adapting from one situation to the next. I’ve been thrust into college, being an adult, learning to drive, and taking on more responsibilities in my church, it’s been hectic. Now that I’ve finished my sophomore year in college, I’ve begun to think and reflect on how far I’ve come and where I should go next. This line of thinking goes hand in hand with my current dilemma, what do I want to do with my life? I know I want to pursue something in the computer science field but I’ve had the longest and hardest time trying to decide what. Now that I’ve finished my software engineering class, I've decided to take the time to sit and reflect on what I've learned and where it'll take me. As I look back on the past and present, I'd like to look towards the future.

## Beyond The Code
My biggest takeaways from my software engineering class have nothing to do with actual code. Something I’ve come to realize over the course of this semester is that there’s so much more to a computer science degree than learning how to code. I've learned that you have to learn how to effectively collaborate and communicate with others. There’s also a lot more creativity involved with coding than I originally thought. Not only can you put your creativity to work when trying to design a webpage or app, you also use it during the development process. Unlike math, there is no one right answer so there are technically endless ways you can come up with solutions to problems. Another big takeaway was me was opening my eyes to the reality of ethics in software engineering. In this day and age of technology and the internet, talking about issues such as privacy and online harassment is as important now as ever. 



## Doing Things the Agile Way 
Work smarter, not harder.

As helpful as tool design patterns are, you can’t expect to write professional-level code with just design patterns. You could have all the cookie cutters in the world, and still not be able to make a cookie in every shape possible. Cookie cutters are just templates, no matter what you do, if all you have are cookie cutters in the shape of hearts, you can’t use them to make a cookie in the shape of a star. In the same way, design patterns can be an inspiration for a solution instead of an actual implementation. Just because your code utilizes a design pattern, it does not mean it’s the most efficient and they aren’t relevant to every problem imaginable.


## 
Much like when it comes to baking, when it comes to design patterns, I'm just a beginner. In my current software engineering class, we have been working and learning about the observer design pattern and more specifically, the publish/subscribe pattern. 


You have a set of data sources (the publishers) and they specify how data is made available provides that data to an event bus. When there is a new state from a publisher, the event bus notifies all the subscribers that are concerned about that publication of the change. This is a fundamental design pattern in Meteor and it was so interesting to learn how it worked and see it in action in our code. For example:
